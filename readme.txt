Wavelet and simulated Annelaing SliP inversion (WASP)

This code uses a wavelet based method to ivnert for slip on a fault using both regional and tele-seismic data. The code is absed on the original tele-seismic approach of Ji et al. (2002) and modified to include regional data (GNSS and strong motion) and for real-time operations by the Centro Sismologico Nacional of Chile. Details of the implementation can be found in Koch et al. (2019)
