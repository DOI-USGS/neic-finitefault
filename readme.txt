Wavelet and simulated Annealing SliP inversion (WASP)

This code uses a wavelet based method to ivnert for slip on a fault using both regional and tele-seismic data. The code is absed on the original tele-seismic approach of Ji et al. (2002) and modified to include regional data (GNSS and strong motion) and for real-time operations by the Centro Sismologico Nacional of Chile. Details of the implementation can be found in Koch et al. (2019).

The surface wave GF bank (fd_bank) is now available in Zenodo, where the user needs to search for "Surface wave Green's functions for WASP slip inversion code".

Example json files for the modelling of multi-segment faults are available now in multi_segment_example. With these files, the user can re-create the geometry for the solution of the 2011 Tohoku event published by the USGS.
